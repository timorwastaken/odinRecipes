        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>1 Ounce boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>4 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 Cups Tomato Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Place chicken on the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
